# Pathways UI Monorepo

This repository is now organized into separate frontend and backend workspaces.

- `frontend/` – Vite + React (TypeScript) application and related assets.
- `backend/` – Placeholder for future server-side services.

To work on the frontend:

```powershell
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Add your backend implementation under the `backend` directory in the framework of your choice.
